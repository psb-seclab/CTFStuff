Part I - Review of Linux command 
## Start Kali, finish the following tasks in terminal
1.0 Download the zip file of lab 2, save it in the home directory
1.1 Go to the home directory
1.2 Create a new folder named "hack_night"
1.3 Enter folder "hack_night"
1.4 Create a folder named "lab1"
1.5 Copy the zip file from your home dir to the current dir. Note: use ~/ to specify your home dir, and use ./ to specify your current dir. 
1.6 Unzip the compressed file to the current dir.
1.7 List all files in the current dir
1.8 Remove the zip file
1.9 Rename folder "lab222" to "lab2"
1.a Enter dir lab2
1.b Go to the parent folder
1.c Use the 'up' key to show the last command, hit 'enter' to execute it.  
1.d Print your current directory, i.e., working directory
1.e Type 'exit' to close the current terminal.

# open up a new terminal, do the following
2.0 go to home dir
2.1 create a new folder named 'test'
2.2 enter 'test'
2.3 create a file called 'test.txt' using the 'touch' command
2.4 open 'test.txt' using sublime
2.5 write something in the file, save it, then close sublime
2.6 show the content of the file
2.7 goto the parent dir
2.8 create a 'tar' file named 'test.tar' from folder 'test'
2.9 create a 'gzip' file named 'test.gzip' from 'test.tar'
2.a remove file 'test.tar' and folder 'test'
2.b decompress 'test.gzip' to get 'test.tar'
2.c decompress 'test.tar' to get folder 'test'

# practice command line shortcuts, * means very useful!
CTRL L = Clear the terminal (*)
Up/Down = show the last/next command (**)
CTRL A = Cursor to start of line (*)
CTRL E = Cursor the end of line
CTRL U = Delete left of the cursor (*)
CTRL K = Delete right of the cursor
CTRL W = Delete word on the left
CTRL Y = Paste (after CTRL U,K or W)
TAB = auto completion of file or command (**)

==================================
Part II - A crash course on Python
# reference
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/

# To run a python script
0 - start a terminal
1 - enter your current working dir where the python script locates. 
3. run the script:
$ python xxxx.py
4. run a script with arguments
$ python xxx.py [arg list]

# Topics to be covered. 
0 variables
1 strings
2 built-in data structures: list, dictionary
3 control-flow
4 loops
5 function
6 io
7 class
8 list comprehension 
9 networking

# exercise 
0 - write a function to generate the ascii table
check this link: http://www.asciitable.com/ for a complete ascii table
Your output should be three collumns:
---------------------
dec 	hex		char
0		0		NUL
...
---------------------
note: colloums are separated by '\t'

1 - write a recusive function to do binary search on a sorted list.
input: a list, the left idx , the right idx, the search key
output: the position of the match, or -1 if there is no match.

2 - write a python function, do the following:
- create a file named 'file1.txt' in the working dir.
- write the whole ascii table you generated to the file.
- creat another file named 'file2.txt' in the working dir
- read contents from 'file1.txt' line by line 
- for each line, replace every '\t' with a ':', then output the result to 'file2.txt'

# python scripts in hacking
0 - Test script '1-vulnScanner.py', a simple vulnerability scanner.
