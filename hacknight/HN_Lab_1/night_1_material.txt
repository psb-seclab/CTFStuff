# System setup
1. Setup Kali linux virtual machine
1.1 [Window] start ==> type 'kali linux' ==> hit 'enter' ==> loading...
1.2 default user id: Kali
1.3 pswd: kali
1.4 open up terminal, type the following cmd for system update:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

2. Setup Sublime text editor
2.1 In Kali, open the web browser “Iceweasel”, go to 
ftp://128.118.102.44
and download a zipped “sublime text” to your “Home” directory! Open terminal, go to Home directory (the default directory)
2.2 unzip the file using:
$ unzip sublime.zip
2.3 “ls” to check a new directory SublimeText is created (unzipped from sublime.zip)
2.4 get into sublime dir 
$ cd SublimeText
2.5 open .bashrc with sublime text
$ ./sublime_text ~/.bashrc
2.6 go to the bottom of the file, add a line
export PATH=$PATH:~/SublimeText
2.7 close the editor
2.8 open a new terminal by “shift+ctrl+N”
2.9 check the $PATH by 
$ echo $PATH
2.10 make a link to sublime executable
$ cd ~/SublimeText
$ ln sublime_text sublime
2.11 open up a new terminal, type
$ sublime
you should be able to open sublime now!


# Linux command basics: 6:45 pm - 7:15 pm
## Legend:
1. Everything in “<>” is to be replaced, ex: <fileName> --> iLovePeanuts.txt
2. Don't include the '=' in your commands

## linux folder notation
/ = root directory
~ = home directory (for the current user)
. = current directory
.. = parent directory
../.. = parent's parent 

## Basic Terminal Navigation
ls -a = list all files and folders
ls <folderName> = list files in folder
ls -lh = Detailed list, Human readable
ls -l *.jpg = list jpeg files only
ls -lh <fileName> = Result for file only
cd <folderName> = change directory
cd / = go to root
cd .. = go up one folder, tip: ../../../
pwd = print working directory
man <command> = shows manual (RTFM)

## Basic file manipulation
cat <fileName> = show content of file
             (less, more)
head = from the top
      -n <#oflines> <fileName>
tail = from the bottom
      -n <#oflines> <fileName>

mkdir = create new folder
mkdir myStuff ..
mkdir myStuff/pictures/ ..

touch <fileName> = create or update a file

cp image.jpg newimage.jpg = copy and rename a file
cp image.jpg <folderName>/ = copy to folder
cp image.jpg folder/sameImageNewName.jpg
cp -R stuff otherStuff = copy and rename a folder
cp *.txt stuff/ = copy all of *<file type> to folder

mv file.txt foldername = move file to a folder
mv <folderName> <folderName2> = rename a folder 
mv filename.txt filename2.txt = rename a file
mv <fileName> stuff/newfileName

rm <fileName> = delete file (s)
rm -i <fileName> .. = ask for confirmation each file 
rm -f <fileName> = force deletion of a file
rm -r <foldername>/ = delete folder

'up' key = show the previous cmd
'down' key = show the next cmd

## open up a file using sublime
$ sublime <filename>

## Process Management
ps -A = show all processes
ps -A | grep 'python' = show processes including word 'python'
kill <proc#> = kill a process by id
sudo halt = to shut down computer
sudo reboot = to reboot

## Flow redirection
'>' at the end of a command to redirect the result to a file
$ ps -A > process.txt
'>>' to redirect the result to the end of a file
$ ls >> process.txt

## Archive and compress data
Step 1, put all the files you want to compress in
the same folder: ex --> mv *.txt folder/

Step 2, Create the tar file:
tar -cvf my_archive.tar folder/
      -c : creates a .tar archive
      -v : tells you what is happening (verbose)
      -f : assembles the archive into one file

Step 3.1, create gzip file (most current): 
$ gzip my_archive.tar
to decompress: 
$ gunzip my_archive.tar.gz

Step 3.2, or create a bzip2 file (more powerful but slow): 
$ bzip2 my_archive.tar
to decompress: 
$ bunzip2 my_archive.tar.bz2

step 4, to decompress the .tar file:
$ tar -xvf archive.tar

## Basic Terminal Shortcuts
CTRL L = Clear the terminal
CTRL D = Logout
SHIFT Page Up/Down = Go up/down the terminal
CTRL A = Cursor to start of line
CTRL E = Cursor the end of line
CTRL U = Delete left of the cursor
CTRL K = Delete right of the cursor
CTRL W = Delete word on the left
CTRL Y = Paste (after CTRL U,K or W)
TAB = auto completion of file or command
